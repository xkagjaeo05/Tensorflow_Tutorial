    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is about a basic form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) called Sentiment Analysis, in which we will try and classify a movie review as either positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a simple example: \"This movie is not very good.\" This text ends with the words \"very good\" which indicates a very positive sentiment, but it is negated because it is preceded by the word \"not\", so the text should be classified as having a negative sentiment. How can we teach a Neural Network to do this classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is that neural networks cannot work directly on text-data, so we need to convert text into numbers that are compatible with a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another problem is that a text may be arbitrarily long. The neural networks we have worked with in previous tutorials use fixed data-shapes - except for the first dimension of the data which varies with the batch-size. Now we need a type of neural network that can work on both short and long sequences of text.\n",

    "You should be familiar with TensorFlow and Keras in general, see Tutorials #01 and #03-C.\n",

    "## Flowchart\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem we need several processing steps. First we need to convert the raw text-words into so-called tokens which are integer values. These tokens are really just indices into a list of the entire vocabulary. Then we convert these integer-tokens into so-called embeddings which are real-valued vectors, whose mapping will be trained along with the neural network, so as to map words with similar meanings to similar embedding-vectors. Then we input these embedding-vectors to a Recurrent Neural Network which can take sequences of arbitrary length as input and output a kind of summary of what it has seen in the input. This output is then squashed using a Sigmoid-function to give us a value between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is taken to mean a negative sentiment and 1.0 means a positive sentiment. This whole process allows us to classify input-text as either having a negative or positive sentiment.\n",
